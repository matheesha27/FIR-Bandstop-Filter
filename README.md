# FIR-Bandstop-Filter
This project is done to design procedure of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Bandstop Filter using the Kaiser Window function. Basic theory of a non-recursive filter is discussed along with the results obtained. MATLAB 2013a software package is used as the programming environment to implement the filter.

This is an individual project. Basic theory, designing steps, results and the conclusion have been included in the documentation.
